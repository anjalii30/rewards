Branches:
   * master
   * staging
   * dev
​
master is the default branch of the project, dev is the offset branch of the master branch and staging is the offset
branch of dev.
​
Note: The following git conventions are to be followed for push and pull requests in the branches.
​
master:
  - should be the default branch of the project.
  - code should be merged to master from dev.
  - no direct commits should be made in this branch.
​
staging:
  - should be the offset of master branch.
  - code is merged to dev from staging.
  - merge can be done only after QA and testing are performed.
  - once merge is done, no changes should be made until feedback is received from the client.
​
dev:
  - should be the offset of staging branch.
  - dev will have ongoing sprint work and may have unstable code.
  - sonar analysis will be configured with dev.
​
Other branching strategy to be followed:
  * use feature branches for all new features and bug fixes
  * merge feature branch into the dev branch using pull request
  * keep the dev branch up-to-date
​
Naming conventions to be followed for feature branches:
   
Use a consistent naming convention for your feature branches to identify the work done in the branch. You can also
include other information in the branch name such as who created the branch. Some suggestions are: 
     
 * users/username/description
 * bugfix/description
 * features/featurename
